# Counterflow and Coflow Analysis

## Project Description
This project simulates and analyzes counterflow and coflow phenomena, focusing on flow characteristics and flame dynamics. It utilizes MATLAB scripts for finite difference methods, boundary conditions, and flame length visualization. The study is relevant to combustion and fluid dynamics research.

## Features
- **Counterflow Simulation**:
  - Models flow characteristics using finite difference methods.
  - Visualizes velocity profiles and flame lengths.
- **Coflow Analysis**:
  - Simulates coflowing jets and their interactions.
  - Provides insights into mixing and flame behavior.

## Included Files
- `coflow.m`: MATLAB script for coflow simulation.
- `counter_flow.m`: Simulates counterflow dynamics.
- `boundary.m`: Implements boundary conditions for counterflow analysis.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2020b or higher.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rmodregoe/counterflow-coflow-analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the `.m` files in MATLAB.
3. Run individual scripts for the desired analysis:
   - Coflow simulation:
     ```matlab
     run('coflow.m')
     ```
   - Counterflow simulation:
     ```matlab
     run('counter_flow.m')
     ```

## Results
- Outputs include velocity profiles, flame lengths, and mixing layer visualizations for coflow and counterflow systems.
- Relevant plots demonstrate the dynamics of the simulated flow fields.
